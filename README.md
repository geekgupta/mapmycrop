Certainly! Below is a sample `Readme.md` file for the authentication API using Django, along with information on Dockerizing and deploying it on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

```markdown
# Authentication API with Django

This project implements a secure authentication API using Django. It includes user registration, authentication, and token-based authorization. The API integrates with Open Meto to retrieve historic weather data.

## 1. Framework Selection

The chosen web framework for this project is Django. Django provides a robust and secure framework for building web applications, including built-in authentication features. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, making it suitable for rapid development and follows best practices for web security.

## 2. User Registration

Implemented an endpoint for user registration. Users can register by providing a unique username and a secure password. Passwords are securely hashed for enhanced security.

## 3. User Authentication

Created an authentication endpoint that validates user credentials (username and password) and returns a token upon successful authentication. The generated tokens have a specified expiration duration for security.

## 4. Token-based Authorization

Implemented a secure endpoint that requires a valid token for access. Only authenticated users with a valid token can access this endpoint.

## 5. API Integration

Integrated with Open Meto (https://open-meteo.com/) to retrieve historic weather data for enhanced functionality.

## 6. Input Validation and Error Handling

Proper input validation is implemented for user registration and authentication endpoints. Meaningful error messages are returned in case of validation failures or other errors, enhancing the user experience.

## 7. Security Considerations

Implemented security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and ensured secure password storage through password hashing.

## 8. Unit Testing

Unit tests are written to validate the functionality of various endpoints, ensuring good test coverage and maintaining code reliability.

## Dockerization and Deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

### Dockerization

The project is Dockerized for containerization. The Dockerfile includes the necessary instructions to build a Docker image.

To build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t authentication-api .
```

### Deployment on GKE

The Docker image can be deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Kubernetes.

Ensure you have the `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your GKE cluster.

To deploy the application:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-deployment.yaml
```

Ensure to replace `your_project` and `your_cluster` with your actual project and cluster names.

For more detailed instructions on setting up GKE, refer to the [official GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs).

```

Please note that you need to provide a `kubernetes-deployment.yaml` file with the appropriate Kubernetes deployment configuration specific to your project and requirements.
